NOTE: Content Localisation has been introduced in Content Studio 3.2 and require XP 7.6.0 or higher

Localisation in Content Studio is done by utilising advanced concept of Content Layers. A layer is a special
type of content project that always has a parent project where it inherits its content from. This inherited content can then be localised
to the language of the layer, restructured, renamed or differently sorted.

You can have as many layers as you need: project "A" in the root can have a child layer "B" which has a child
layer "C" and so on. Content changes will be propagated top-down from the project/layer the content was originally changed in, through
all the layers down to the bottommost descendant. In our example, any content created in "A" will be automatically created in the child "B"
and the grand-child "C", while content created in "B" will be auto-created only in "C".

The moment an inherited content is modified (localised), it will be "unlinked" from its parent and will no longer be synchronised.
If you modify a content in the layer "C", it will stop inheriting content changes from the layer "B". However, the same content in "B" still
inherits content changes from its parent project "A", until it's localised in "B" as well.

There are 4 different types of inheritance that are supported independently: content data, sorting, parent and name.
This means, for example, that if a child layer has inherited an entire website from its parent, you can change sorting order of content items
inside this site in "B" which will stop inheritance only of _sorting_ from the project A, however inheritance of _content data_ will still continue.
Another example, is that you can move a content item from one parent content to another in the layer B, but this content will still be
inheriting data changes from the project A.

Content Layers are using the <<projects,Content Projects'>> engine under the hood, which means that each layer has its own content repository,
language, read permissions and roles.

Just like projects, layers can be created and managed in the Settings section.
