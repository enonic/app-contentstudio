NOTE: Juke AI is in early stages. Errors may occur, and responses will improve over time

== Field context

It may often be useful to focus Juke's attention on a specific field. Clicking or focusing on a supported form field will instantly trigger Juke's attention, by setting the field as a chat context.

To clear the context, simply click the `x` to the right.

NOTE: Juke is currently limited to work with TextLine, TextArea and HtmlArea fields in the main content type form. More will follow soon.

== Mentions
Fields may also be mentioned directly in the chat. Pressing `@` in the input will list all available fields in the scope of the current context. Select a field from the list to make it part of your prompt.

NOTE: If no context is set, you may mention fields at the root level of your content

* Create `@Display Name` based on `@Article body`

Finally, the `Copy to buffer` icon will copy the text to your clipboard, allowing you to paste it manually later.

== Variants

On demand, Juke may provide multiple variants for a single field. Use the arrow icons next to the response which you can use to navigate through the suggestions, and insert values as required.

For instance you may want Juke ot use a consistent tone of voice, or provide other relevant details about the content you are working on. This helps Juke produce more relevant responses every time.
