= Content Storage
:toc: right
:imagesdir: storage/images

Content in XP is stored in <<storage/projects#,Content Projects>>, each having its own underlying repository. In a clean new instance of XP
there's only one project (called "Default") which cannot be deleted but <<config#disable_default_project,can be disabled>> using the
configuration file.

Users with privileged permissions can create their own Content Projects and localise content in these projects using <<storage/layers#,Content Layers>>, which essentially is a special type of project inheriting content from an upstream project while enabling localisation into a specific language.

Each project/layer (except for the default one) can be set up with independent access level and a set of default permissions for new content.

Content that is no longer needed can be deleted for good or put into <<storage/archive#,Archive>> for future reference.
Each project/layer has its own Archive.


== Project Context

If current user has access to more than one project or layer, he/she will be asked to select the context after opening Content Studio.

Project context can be switched at any time by using project selector in the Content Studio header:

NOTE: <<issues#,*Issues*>> are context-dependent which means that an issue can be accessed only from inside the project it was created in.

Current project context is also shown in the Content Wizard header:

IMPORTANT: If the Default project is <<config#disable_default_project,hidden>> via config file and a logged-in user doesn't have access to any projects and has necessary permissions, he/she will be asked to create a new Content Project using <<storage/projects#new_project_wizard,multistep wizard>>.
