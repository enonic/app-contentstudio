= Context Panel
:toc: right
:imagesdir: images

This panel is a multi-function tool that can be toggled open and closed with the cog icon on the right of the toolbar.  It is used in conjunction with the <<./page-editor#, Page Editor>> to work with components on the page.
The panel contains a widget selector consisting of a few built-in widgets shown on top of the list, followed by custom widgets coming from installed applications.

== Components

Using the components widget, you can choose the template for the page, then drag and drop components onto the page.  This widget consist of two tabs, Insert and Inspect.

=== Insert tab

This tab has a list of Component types that can be added to the page in a two step process. The first step is to drag and drop a component type placeholder to a region in the page editor. The second step is to select the specific component from a dropdown selector in the placeholder.

For example, to add a part component called “Categories” to the page, simply click the part icon (puzzle piece) and drag it to a region in the page editor. A red circle appears when the component is dragged over an area where it cannot be dropped. A green checkbox appears when dragged over valid locations and a blue box shows where the component will land.

Once the part placeholder is dropped, it will have a combo-box where the “Categories” part can be selected from the list. When a component placeholder is selected, the inspection panel will also show a combo-box with a list of available part components.

=== Inspect tab

This is where components are configured.  The inspection panel displays form inputs matching the configuration of whichever component is selected in the page editor, and changes name to match the type of component, so for instance, in the first screenshot above, the tab is named "Page".

Some components won’t have any configuration settings. The page will not update as configuration values change until the content is saved or when changes are applied with the button at the bottom of the panel.

The inspect tab is also used for changing the default page template of a selected content and choosing a page component to render content that does not have a supporting page template. Read more about this in Page Templates.

== Details

The details widget will show some basic information about the selected component, including location, status, permissions, basic meta data, component type and attachments.

== Version History

This widget lists all versions of the selected content, highlighting the published version, if there is one, and makes it possible to restore old versions.

== Dependencies

Here are two quick links to content that are referencing the current content (inbound) and content that the current conntent is referencing (outbound).  Click on either box to see the content in a new window.
