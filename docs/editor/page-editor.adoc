= Page Editor
:toc: right
:imagesdir: images

Page Editor is a modifiable preview of the content page that will open automatically when a content that has a supporting page template is created or edited. It is used in conjunction with the <<./context-panel#, Context Panel>> to add, remove, and move components around the page with drag and drop. The page editor can be toggled with the image:page-editor-icon-monitor.png[Monitor icon,30,30] icon on the far right of the toolbar.

== Page controller

As mentioned earlier, Page Editor panel won't be displayed for a content that can't be rendered, such as Folder, Media, or a Shortcut.

Page Editor will be shown but not available for a *Site* without at least one application that contains a template or a controller that implement rendering.

If there is at least one application, but the template was not set automatically, the dropdown with the list of available templates and controllers will appear.

== Editor panel

The page that uses a template is locked for editing. Clicking on it, or inside the <<#components-view,Components View>> will show the menu with the option to enable the editing.

A component can be selected in the page editor by clicking on it. This will highlight the selected component and show its configuration in the inspect panel. Right-clicking a component will open a context menu with various actions that can be performed on the component. These options may include *Select parent*, *Insert* another component, *Inspect* its configuration, *Reset* the componentâ€™s configuration, *Remove* the component, *Duplicate* it, and *Save as fragment*.

For the *Fragment* component, the last action will be replaced with the *Detach from fragment* and the *Edit* action will be added.

== Preview modes

Similar to the preview mode selector in the Navigator's <<../navigator#preview_panel, Preview panel>>, Page Editor has its own preview mode selector located in the top-right corner of the panel. Predefined modes are Automatic (default, the best suitable mode), Media, Enonic rendering, and JSON.

== Page widget

Page Editor adds a new Page widget to the widget list in the Context Panel. This widget can be used to switch between different templates and controllers for the current content and manage components on the page.

== Page Components tree

When the Content form is collapsed (with the image:page-editor-icon-collapse.png[Collapse icon,30,30] icon in the menu toolbar), the Page Components tree will automatically undock and switch into floating mode.

This view can be collapsed with the image:page-editor-components-collapse.png[Collapse icon,30,30] icon in the view header and the tree will be docked inside the vertical menu toolbar on the left. Clicking the image:page-editor-components-expand.png[Expand icon,30,30] icon will reopen the view again.
