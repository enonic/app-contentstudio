= Page Editor
:toc: right
:imagesdir: images

Page Editor is a modifiable preview of the content page that will open automatically when a content that has a supporting page template is created or edited. It is used in conjunction with the <<./context-panel#, Context Panel>> to add, remove, and move components around the page with drag and drop. The page editor can be closed and reopened with the icon on the far right of the toolbar that looks like a computer monitor.

== Selecting controller

As mentioned earlier, Page Editor panel won't be displayed for a content that can't be rendered, such as Folder, Image or a Shortcut.

Page Editor will be shown but not available for a *Site* without at least one application that contains a template or a controller that implement rendering.

If there is at least one application, but the template was not set automatically, the dropdown with the list of available templates and controllers will appear.

== Editing page

The page with the automatic template is disabled for editing. Clicking on it, or inside the <<#components-view,Components View>> will show the menu with the option to enable the editing.

A component can be selected in the page editor by clicking on it. This will highlight the selected component and show its configuration in the inspect panel. Right-clicking a component will open a context menu with various actions that can be performed on the component. These options may include *Select parent*, *Insert* another component, *Inspect* its configuration, *Reset* the componentâ€™s configuration, *Remove* the component, *Duplicate* it, and *Save as fragment*.

For the *Fragment* component, the last action will be replaced with the *Detach from fragment* and the *Edit* action will be added.

== Page Editor widgets

When *Page Editor* is available, you'll have access to all default widgets, including <<../widgets#emulator,Emulator>> and <<../widgets#components,Components>> widgets.

== Page Components tree

When the Content form is collapsed (with the "<" icon in the menu toolbar), the Page Components tree will automatically undock and switch into floating mode.

This view can be collapsed with the icon in the view header and the tree will be docked inside the vertical menu toolbar - its icon will appear at the bottom of the toolbar. Clicking the icon will reopen the view again.
