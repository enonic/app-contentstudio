= Content Form
:toc: right
:imagesdir: images

This panel appears on the left side of the page after content is created or while being edited. It is here the form appears in which content
data is entered. The structure and fields in the form are determined by the *content type* which is defined in the application code.
The content editor panel can be collapsed to give the page editor more room by clicking the arrow icon on the top right of the panel.

The top of the content form has the content type icon, the Display Name, and the content path name.
The default icon can be replaced with an image file by clicking on it. When the Display Name is being changed, the path name will change
accordingly to a URL-friendly version. It is also possible for the Display Name to be generated dynamically using values from other form
fields by using a https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types#display_name_expressions[Display Name expression].

NOTE: Value of the Path field must be unique and will be validated against existing content every time the field is changed.

TIP: For a new content Path will be auto-generated as you type into the Display field. International letters will be automatically
transliterated into their english equivalents. It's possible to turn off this behaviour in the Content Studio's <<configuration_file#, config file>>.

After content has been published, the path field gets locked and user has to click the pencil icon to rename content in the dedicated
modal dialog. These precautions aim to prevent accidental breaking of external hard-coded links.

Underneath is a toolbar with clickable navigation steps that correspond to different sections of the content form. The first one is always
content type name, and the last ones are icons for the *Schedule* (only for published content), *Settings* and *Access* wizard steps.
In between, there might be *X-data* and *Mixins* steps enabled for this content. Clicking on an item in the toolbar will scroll the content
form down to the corresponding section.

Form fields in the content data section depend on how the content type was set up.

*Schedule* section is where the period of time, during which a content is available online, can be modified.

NOTE: *Schedule* section is only displayed for published content.

*Settings* section is where the content’s Language and Owner are set. The *Language* will be inherited from the parent content if it was
set there. The *Owner* will be the logged in user who created the content, but it could be changed if the current user has the right permissions.

Content permissions can be modified in the dedicated modal dialog.
Content will by default inherit the <<../permissions#,permissions>> of the parent content when created.

To modify permissions, uncheck "Inherit permissions" checkbox, then you will be able to remove/add principals and modify their permissions.
Clicking on any item here will expand it and show what permissions the principal has.
