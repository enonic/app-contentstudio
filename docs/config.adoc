This section describes how to configure Content Studio via the config file.

The file should be called `com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg` and placed into the `$XP_HOME/config` folder of your XP installation.

=== Disable "Mark as Ready" in the Publishing Wizard

Whenever the Publishing Wizard contains at least one item that is "_Work in progress_", publishing will be disabled. The editor can
overrule this by applying "*Mark as ready*" bulk action from the button dropdown menu and marking all of such items as "_Ready for Publishing_".

To add another level of restriction and prevent accidental publishing of items that are not ready for publishing, the "*Mark as ready*" bulk action
can be disabled by adding the following parameter to the config file:
