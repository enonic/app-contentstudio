This section describes how to configure Content Studio via the config file.

The file should be called `com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg` and placed into the `$XP_HOME/config` folder of your XP installation.

=== Html Editor XSS

Content Studio's Rich Editor automatically removes any `<script>` and `<iframe>` tags from the source code.
This measurement effectively reduces potential for XSS injections.
This also removes any scripts from documents migrated from XP 6 on first save.

Iframes can still be added through the use of the built-in `embed` https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/macros#built_in_macros[macro].

You can allow `<script>` tag in html fields at your own risk by adding the following to the config file:

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
htmlinput.allowScripts = true
----

=== Disable "Mark as Ready" in the Publishing Wizard

Whenever the Publishing Wizard contains at least one item that is "_Work in progress_", publishing will be disabled. The editor can
overrule this by applying "*Mark as ready*" bulk action from the button dropdown menu and marking all of such items as "_Ready for Publishing_".

To add another level of restriction and prevent accidental publishing of items that are not ready for publishing, the "*Mark as ready*" bulk action
can be disabled by adding the following parameter to the config file:

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
publishingWizard.allowContentUpdate = false
----

=== Matching mode for content type patterns

Defines matching mode for content type patterns. Can be `MATCH` or `LEGACY`. Default: `MATCH`. See https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/input-types#allowContentType[description].

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentTypePatternMode = MATCH
----

=== Max file upload size

Used for setting size limit on attachments, media content and both project and content thumbnail uploads

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
uploadMaxFileSize = 100mb
----
