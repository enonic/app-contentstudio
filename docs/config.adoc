This section describes how to configure Content Studio via the config file.

The file should be called `com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg` and placed into the `$XP_HOME/config` folder of your XP installation.

=== Disable "Mark as Ready" in the Publishing Wizard

Whenever the Publishing Wizard contains at least one item that is "_Work in progress_", publishing will be disabled. The editor can
overrule this by applying "*Mark as ready*" bulk action from the button dropdown menu and marking all of such items as "_Ready for Publishing_".

To add another level of restriction and prevent accidental publishing of items that are not ready for publishing, the "*Mark as ready*" bulk action
can be disabled by adding the following parameter to the config file:

.Enable Mark as Ready button in the Publishing Wizard
[source,properties]
----
publishingWizard.allowContentUpdate = false
----

=== Matching mode for content type patterns

Defines matching mode for content type patterns. Can be `MATCH` or `LEGACY`. Default: `MATCH`.

image:cs-400.svg[CS 4.0.0,opts=inline]

Used for setting size limit on attachments, media content and both project and content thumbnail uploads

.Limit file size
[source,properties]
----
uploadMaxFileSize = 100mb
----

=== Content path transliteration

image:cs-400.svg[CS 4.0.0,opts=inline]

Turn off automatic transliteration of content path when generating it based on a value typed into the display name field in the Content form.

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentWizard.allowPathTransliteration=false
----

=== Collaboration mode

image:cs-410.svg[CS 4.1.0,opts=inline]

Turn on Collaboration mode in the Content Wizard which will display avatar icons of users who currently have the same content opened.

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentWizard.enableCollaboration=true
----

=== Content Security Policy

image:cs-410.svg[CS 4.1.0,opts=inline]

Turn off <<security#_content_security_policy,Content Security Policy>> by setting `contentSecurityPolicy.enabled` property to `false`.

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentSecurityPolicy.enabled=false
----

You can provide your own header for <<security#_content_security_policy,Content Security Policy>> using `contentSecurityPolicy.header` property.
For example, if you are using Google Analytics app then CSP header has to be customised, since GA injects its own scripts referring to external domains which have to be allowed in CSP.

Below is the header to be used for CSP if you want the Google Analytics widget not to be blocked in Content Studio:

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentSecurityPolicy.header=default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' ws: wss: https://*.gstatic.com https://*.googleapis.com; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.google.com https://*.googleapis.com https://*.gstatic.com; object-src 'none'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data:; frame-src 'self' https://*.googleapis.com
