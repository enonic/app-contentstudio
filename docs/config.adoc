This section describes how to configure Content Studio via the config file.

The file should be called `com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg` and placed into the `$XP_HOME/config` folder of your XP installation.

== Matching mode for content type patterns

Defines matching mode for content type patterns. Can be `MATCH` or `LEGACY`. Default: `MATCH`.
See https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/schemas/input-types/contentselector#allowContentType[description].

.Set matching mode
[source,properties]
----
contentTypePatternMode = MATCH
----

== Max file upload size

Used for setting size limit on attachments, media content and both project and content thumbnail uploads

.Limit file size
[source,properties]
----
uploadMaxFileSize = 100mb
----

== Content path transliteration

Turn off automatic transliteration of content path when generating it based on a value typed into the display name field in the Content form.

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentWizard.allowPathTransliteration=false
----

== Content Security Policy

IMPORTANT: You may need to tweak CSP settings in Content Studio _only_ if you are building a widget which will be embedded inside Content Studio where you want to allow references to external resources or other potentially unsafe (from the CSP point of view) actions. If CSP
errors appear when your content is rendered (when you preview or edit content in Content Studio), then you need to configure CSP settings in https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/deployment/config#admin[XP admin config].

You can provide your own header for <<security#_content_security_policy,Content Security Policy>> using `contentSecurityPolicy.header` property.
For example, Google Analytics injects its own scripts referring to external domains, so
we are using the following CSP headers for the Google Analytics widget not to be blocked in Content Studio:

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentSecurityPolicy.header=default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' ws: wss: https://*.gstatic.com https://*.googleapis.com; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.google.com https://*.googleapis.com https://*.gstatic.com; object-src 'none'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data:; frame-src 'self' https://*.googleapis.com
----

Turn off <<security#content_security_policy,Content Security Policy>> by setting `contentSecurityPolicy.enabled` property to `false`.

.com.enonic.app.contentstudio.cfg
[source,properties]
----
contentSecurityPolicy.enabled=false
----

== Publishing Wizard

=== Disable "Mark as Ready" action

Whenever the Publishing Wizard contains at least one item that is "_Work in progress_", publishing will be disabled. The editor can solve
this by clicking the "*Mark as ready*" link on top of the dialog, which will mark all such items as "_Ready for Publishing_".

To add another level of restriction and prevent accidental publishing of items that are not ready for publishing, the "*Mark as ready*" bulk action
can be disabled by adding the following parameter to the config file:

.Hide Mark as Ready action in the Publishing Wizard
[source,properties]
----
publishingWizard.allowContentUpdate = false
----

=== Default Online From time

Default Online From time is set to 12:00 by default. This default value can be changed by setting the `publishingWizard.defaultPublishFromTime` config property.

image::pubwiz-online-from.png[Default Online From time in the Publishing Wizard, 75%]


.Default Online From time in the Publishing Wizard
[source,properties]
----
publishingWizard.defaultPublishFromTime = 12:00
----

=== Exclude optional dependencies

By default, all dependencies of content items staged for publishing will also be included to ensure no broken
references will appear online. Some of these (for example, all the ascendants of selected items or their inbound dependencies)
are required for publishing and cannot be excluded from the publishing batch, while others (like outbound dependencies) are optional.

image::pubwiz-dependencies-all.png[Publishing Wizard - all dependencies, 75%]

It's possible to overrule the default behaviour of including all the dependencies by setting the `publishingWizard.excludeDependencies` config property to `true`.

.Exclude optional dependencies
[source,properties]
----
publishingWizard.excludeDependencies = true
----

With this flag turned on, only mandatory dependencies will be included, while optional can be added from the "*Show excluded*" mode.

image::pubwiz-dependencies-mandatory.png[Publishing Wizard - mandatory dependencies, 75%]

image::pubwiz-dependencies-optional.png[Publishing Wizard - optional dependencies, 75%]

IMPORTANT: Use this flag with caution. It makes it very simple to publish a content without its outgoing dependencies which may result in broken references, missing images etc.
