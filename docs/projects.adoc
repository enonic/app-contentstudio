Content Studio allows you to organize your content in multiple independent repositories.

Content Projects also offer individual access control and permissions, as well as other settings to toggle features and language(s) for the project.

Privileged users can <<settings#, manage Content Projects>>

== Project context

The project context is always visible in the Content Studio header. If you have access to multiple projects, you can easily swich to a different project in the context selector:
Project context can be switched at any time by using project selector in the Content Studio header:

The project is also visible when you are editing a single content item:

For new Enonic installations, you will have to <<settings#new_project_wizard,create an initial content project>>.

== Project layering

Content Studio also offers an advanced feature for reusing and augmenting content across multiple projects. This is called <<layers#, content layering>>.


== The default project

IMPORTANT: Older Enonic installations may be using a `Default` project. 

As of Content Studio 5, this is disabled by default, but can be <<config#disable_default_project,enabled via config file>>.
