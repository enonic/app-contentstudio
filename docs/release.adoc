== Content Studio 5

IMPORTANT: Content Studio 5.0 requires XP 7.13.0 or higher.

=== Default Content Project is hidden by default

Default Content Project is no longer available in Content Studio without tweaking the config file.

If you need the Default project (for example, you already have content in it and want to continue working with it after
upgrading to Content Studio 5), enable it via Content Studio's <<config#enable_default_content_project,config file>>.


=== Page Components View

Page Components View, which used to be a floating modal window inside Page Editor, is now made a part
of the <<editor/content-form#page_components_tree,Content Wizard form>>. It will be automatically undocked whenever the Content Form is collapsed.
