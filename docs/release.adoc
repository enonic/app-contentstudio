=== Improved auto-exclusion of optional dependencies

The new mode for auto-exclusion of optional dependencies in the Publishing Wizard, originally introduced in Content Studio 5.0, has been improved to not hide the auto-excluded dependencies but  keep them visible (while still excluded) in the list.

TIP: This mode can be turned on in Content Studio's <<config#exclude_optional_dependencies,config file>>

=== Export of search results

Search results produced by Content Navigator's <<navigator#search_panel,Search Panel>> can now be exported into a CSV file using the download icon next to the Search Panel's free-text search field. The file will contain the following fields: *Id*, *Path*, *Creator*, *Modifier*, *Created*, *Modified*, *Owner*, *Content Type*, *Display Name*, *Language*, *Published From*, *Published Until*, *First Published*.

=== New Find/Replace dialog in Rich Text Editor

The old <<editor/rich-text-editor#findreplace,Find/Replace dialog>> in the Rich Text Editor that used to cover the text it was searching inside has been replaced with the new inline dialog that allows editor to use the search/replace functions without blocking the source text.

=== Locked path for published content

* When a published item has been first moved, then modified its status will be shown as `Moved, Modified` (previously just `Moved`)

* "Show changes" link for comparison of publishing modifications is replaced with an icon

* New icon for switching the project context

== Content Studio 5

IMPORTANT: Content Studio 5.0 requires XP 7.13.0 or higher.

=== Default Content Project is hidden by default

Default Content Project is no longer available in Content Studio without tweaking the config file.

If you need the Default project (for example, you already have content in it and want to continue working with it after
upgrading to Content Studio 5), enable it via Content Studio's <<config#enable_default_content_project,config file>>.


=== Page Components View

Page Components View, which used to be a floating modal window inside Page Editor, is now made a part
of the <<editor/content-form#page_components_tree,Content Editor form>>. It will be automatically undocked whenever the Content Form is collapsed.
