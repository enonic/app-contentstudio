:imagesdir: editor/images

The *Content Editor* opens in a new browser tab from the <<navigator#,Browse View>> when content is created or edited. Clicking on the *Content Studio* tree icon in the top left corner will open the <<navigator#,Browse View>> in a new browser tab. User will get a browser warning upon trying to close a tab with modified but unsaved content.

The edit view consists of several parts. On the left is the <<editor/content-form#,Content Form>>. If the content is editable, the <<editor/page-editor#,Page Editor>> will automatically open on the right. A click on the image:context-panel-icon.png[title=Context panel icon, width=24px] in the top right corner will open the <<editor/context-panel#, Context Panel>>. In addition to the same widgets that are available from the Browser View, there's one special widget here called "Page" which provides page editing capabilities.
