Content can be created, edited, archived, deleted, duplicated, moved, sorted and published. Depending on permissions, users may perform those actions on selected content items.


== New

The `New` action will launch the *New Content* dialog.

There are three ways to open the *New Content* dialog in Content Studio:

* The first method is with the shortcut — `alt + n`;
* By clicking the `New` button in the toolbar;
* By clicking `New` in the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item.

NOTE: The *New Content* dialog will use the context of the selected content to create the new item. If no context is set, the item will be created on the root level.


=== New by Type

The *New Content* dialog lets you choose from available content types, based on the context of the selected item.

* Select from the list of all content types;
* Select from the "Most Popular" list (most used content types in your current context);
* Select from the "Recently Used" list (based on users recent actions).

TIP: To filter the list of items — simply start typing on your keyboard to filter the list of available content types.

Once a content type is selected, a new item is created, and the content editor is launched in a new tab.


=== New by Uploading

Create file-based content aka "media" from the new content dialog by uploading.
There are two ways to upload files:

* Click the upload icon placed in the top right of the dialog;
* Drag'n drop — also supports bulk uploading.

image::dialog-new-media.png[]

NOTE: When uploading files, the underlying content type is automatically detected from the file type file uploaded.


== Edit

`Edit` action will open the *Content Wizard* for editing selected content items in a new tab.
If multiple items are selected, then the action will open a browser tab for each one.

There are four ways to open content for edit in Content Studio:

* The first method is with the shortcut — `⌘ + e` (`ctrl + e` for Windows);
* By clicking the `Edit` button in the toolbar;
* By double-clicking the item in the grid;
* By clicking `Edit` in the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item.


== Archive

:imagesdir: images
image:cs-400.svg[CS 4.0.0,opts=inline]

`Archive` action will open the *Archive item(s)* dialog for selected content to move it to the "Archive".

There are three ways to open the *Archive item(s)* dialog in Content Studio:

* The first method is with the shortcut — `⌘ + del` (`ctrl + del` for Windows);
* By clicking the `Archive` button in the toolbar;
* By selecting `Archive` from the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item.

TIP: If you want to delete content rather than move it to archive, you can do that by selecting *Delete" from the
button dropdown in the *Archive item(s)* dialog.

IMPORTANT: Online content will instantly go offline after archiving or deleting.

== Duplicate

The `Duplicate` action will launch the *Duplicate content* dialog for the selected content.

There are two ways to open this dialog in Content Studio:

* By clicking the `Duplicate` button in the toolbar;
* By clicking `Duplicate` in the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item.

In the dialog, you can choose whether child items of selected content(s) should also be duplicated or not by pressing the tree icon to the left of the content. Pressing the "Duplicate" button in the dialog will trigger the duplicate operation which will be visualized by a progress bar if the process is taking more than a few seconds. Duplicates will get a new id and path names will be postfixed with `-copy` or `-copy-*` with a number instead of an asterisk starting with `2` if it is not the first copy.

=== Duplicating from the wizard

When the `Duplicate` button is clicked from inside the Content Wizard, only the current item will be selected in the dialog.


== Move

The `Move` action will launch the *Move item(s) with children* dialog for the selected content.

There are two ways to open this dialog in Content Studio:

* By clicking the `Move` button in the toolbar;
* By clicking `Move` in the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item.

This feature moves selected items with all children and current permissions to another place in the tree grid. Type to search, or use the dropdown arrow, to find the new parent content where the selected items will be moved to. If the `Move` button in the dialog is clicked without choosing a parent content then the items will be moved to the *root* of the content tree.

Content cannot be moved to a location where another content already exists with the same path name.

== Sort

The `Sort` action will launch the *Sort items* dialog for the selected content.

There are two ways to open this dialog in Content Studio:

* By clicking the `Sort` button in the toolbar;
* By clicking `Sort` in the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item.

Child items of any content can be sorted in a number of ways through the *Sort items* dialog.

The default sorting is by the *Modified date* in descending order.

You can sort items in ascending or descending order by Modified date, Created date, Display name or Publish date. Children can also be manually sorted by simply dragging them in the *Sort items* dialog.

image::dialog-sort.png[]

Once items are sorted, the parent content will have an arrow in the browse view tree grid pointed up or down to denote ascending or descending. If the content is manually sorted, an icon with three horizontal bars will appear.

Clicking the bars or arrow icon will open the *Sort items* dialog.

In the image below, `/Posts/Featured Image` is sorted by Display name in ascending order, `/Posts/Gotham Sure Is A Big Town` is sorted by Published date in ascending order, and `/Posts` has custom sorting.

== Preview

The `Preview` action will open and render a selected Site or Page in the new tab.

There are two ways to open this dialog in Content Studio:

* By clicking the `Preview` button in the toolbar;
* By clicking `Preview` in the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item.


== Publish

Publishing is a simple but important concept for working with content in Enonic XP. The basic concept of publishing is that it makes content viewable to others outside of Content Studio.

The `Publish` action will launch the *Publishing Wizard* dialog for the selected content.

There are three ways to open the *Publishing Wizard* dialog in Content Studio:

* Via keyboard shortcut — `⌘ + alt + p` (`ctrl + alt + p` for Windows)
* By using the `Publish` button in the toolbar
* By right-clicking an item in the Content grid and selecting `Publish` from the context menu

image::dialog-publish-button.png[]

The Publish button in the toolbar has a dropdown menu with various actions for currently selected item(s).

 * <<workflow#ready_for_publishing,*Mark as ready*>> (only for content in progress) will mark selected item(s) as ready
 * *Publish* will open the Publishing dialog for the selected item(s)
 * <<#_publish-tree,*Publish Tree*>> will open the same dialog but will include all the selected items' children and dependencies
 * <<#_unpublish,*Unpublish*>> (available only for published item(s)) will open the *Unpublish* dialog
 * <<workflow#publish_request,*Request Publishing*>>  (available only for unpublished item(s))
 * <<#_create-issue,*Create Task*>> will open the *New Task* dialog.

NOTE: Default action of the toolbar button is always the first available action from the dropdown menu.

=== Draft and master branches

Content created in Content Studio will originally be created in the *draft* branch with status `New` and workflow state `In progress`.
This content in the *draft* branch can be edited and previewed until it is ready to be `Published`.
Every time a content is saved with changes, a new version is created.

When a content is published, the active version is copied from the *draft* branch to the *master* branch.
Only content in the *master* branch can be accessed by users outside of Content Studio, subject to the contents security settings.

=== Content status

Published content will have the status `Published` while content that has not yet been published will show either as `New`
(if it has never been published) or `Unpublished` (if it was published and then unpublished).
When changes to a published content are saved, the new version becomes the active version in the `draft` branch,
but the active version in the `master` branch remains unchanged. The status of the new active version will be *modified* and this content
will have to be published again for the changes to go online. In other words, each publishing operations overwrites the active version in the
`master` branch with the active version from the `draft` branch.

A published content can either be instantly deleted or marked as deleted in the <<#_delete,*Delete*>> dialog.
Upon instant deletion the content will be instantly removed from both the `draft` and the `master` branches, making it inaccessible online.
However, items marked as deleted will be shown with status `Marked for deletion` in Content Studio but will remain visible online.
Such items must either be published in order to delete them from both branches, or you can use "*Undo delete*" action to remove the "Marked for deletion" mark.

=== Publishing wizard

Content is published through the *Publishing Wizard* dialog. When a content is selected for publishing, its parents and all the related content
will be published along with it. For example, in the image below, a content named "_March madness_" was selected for publishing.
This post has two related *Category* content items (_/parent_ and _/parent/first-child-category_) and one related *Author* item (_/authors/michael-lazell_).
Therefore, these two categories and the author are automatically included in the list of items to be published, and all the ascendants of the dependent items will also be included.

image::publishing-wizard-1.png[]

The Calendar icon next to the "Publish Now" button enables <<#_scheduled-publishing,Scheduled Publishing>> of the selected content.

TIP: Total number of items that will be published is displayed on the *Publish Now* button.

TIP: If current user is missing publishing permissions for selected item(s), the "*Publish All*" button will be replaced with "*Request Publishing*"
(read more about publish requests <<workflow#publish_request,here>>).

=== Publish Tree

If the selected content has children then these items can be automatically included by clicking the tree icon to the left of the content.
As you can see from the picture below, clicking the icon has added add all descendants of the originally selected content to the publishing
list and the number on the "Publish Now" button has increased from 9 to 15.

image::publishing-wizard-2.png[]

TIP: You can use "x" icon on the right-hand side to exclude items from publishing. Sometimes this icon is disabled, this means that the item
cannot be excluded, either because it's a dependency required for publishing of the originally selected item(s), or it has its children in
the list (and child items cannot be published without publishing all of their ascendants). In the latter case, start excluding children first,
then parents will be allowed to be excluded as well.

=== Validation

Content Studio has a built-in validation which ensures that invalid items or items that are still "work in progress" cannot be published.

image::publishing-wizard-exclude.png[]

If the list of items to be published contains invalid items or items that are in "In progress" workflow state, they will be shown on
top of the list and validation notification will be shown on top of the dialog. The "Publish Now" button will then be disabled.
If the problematic items don't have to be published, you can use "*Exclude all*" links to remove these items from the list.

In the case of "_Work in progress_" items, the Publishing Wizard will give you an option to mark all such items as "_Ready for Publishing_".

image::publishing-wizard-mark-as-ready.png[]

Once all the problematic items are either removed or moved from "In progress" to "Ready", the "*Publish Now*" button will automatically become enabled.

=== Scheduled publishing

The Calendar icon in the *Publishing Wizard* dialog will open a section on top of the dialog where you can schedule the period of time
when the content should be online. "Publish Now" button will then change its label to "Schedule".

image::publishing-wizard-schedule.png[]

NOTE: Only offline items will be scheduled. All other changes will be published immediately.

=== Publishing from the Content Wizard

When the `Publish` button is clicked from inside the Content Wizard, only the currently opened item will be selected in the dialog.

== Unpublish

Currently published content can be taken offline with the "Unpublish" feature.
All the content’s descendants will be listed and unpublished along with the selected content.
The total number of content items that will be taken offline will appear on the red `Unpublish` button at the bottom of the dialog.

There are two ways to open this dialog in Content Studio:

* By clicking the `Unpublish` option button in the toolbar (it will replace the `Publish` button for the published content, otherwise it can be found in the publish menu dropdown, next to the `Publish` button);
* By selecting `Unpublish` from the context menu, which is accessible by right-clicking an item, where it will replace `Publish` option for the published content.

Unpublishing a published content that is marked for deletion will first take it offline and then delete it.

image::dialog-unpublish.png[]

NOTE: Just like with deletion, you will be asked to confirm the Unpublish action by entering the total number of items to be unpublished.

== Create Issue

NOTE: In-depth reference on the issues can be found in the separate <<issues#,chapter>>.

== Request Publishing

This action will replace "Publish" for a user that doesn't have sufficient publishing permissions for a content item.

NOTE: In-depth reference on the publish requests can be found <<workflow#publish_request,here>>.
